Databases 2022-2023 Website

Big thanks to thesstrans.com for the pictures

My first HTML/CSS work, the implementation was basic due to limited time.

First, run the dump in MySQLWorkbench from the transport.mwb file.
Import MySQLdb in your python environment and fill the 9th line with your Workbench variables.
db = MySQLdb.connect(host="your_hostname", user="your_username", passwd="your_password", db="publictransportdb").
You are ready to run the code and use the website.
